As a team member you have access to create a new solution by cloning this repository and following the **Storage Conventions** for the lab.

The initial skeleton of the lab should include the `skeleton/README.md` solution file.
 

## Git repository best practices 

> Some of the best practices and recommendations described in this guide in terms of *Git Branching Strategy* are based from this model: [http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/)

The branching strategy recommended to maintain your solutions follows a three-stages and tagging approach.

In order to create a new branch, you can run the following command:

     # git branch -b NAME_OF_BRANCH

In order to jump into your new branch, you can run the command:

     # git checkout NAME_OF_BRANCH
